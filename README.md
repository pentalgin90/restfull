This project uses Spring Boot platform for merchandize catalog.
This project is test code for company novacom.
This application doesn't keep status, so it can be easily scaled
I used:
    Spring boot 2.2.1.RELEASE
    Swagger2 2.9.2
    Spring Data Jpa 2.2.1.RELEASE
    Database as postgresql
    H2 database for tests
    Actuator for lifecycle
